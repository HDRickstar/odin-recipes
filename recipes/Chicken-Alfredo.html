    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken Alfredo is a creamy pasta dish known for its rich, velvety sauce and tender pieces of seasoned chicken.
         Grilled or pan-seared chicken breast is sliced and served over fettuccine noodles that are coated in a smooth Alfredo sauce made from butter, heavy cream, and Parmesan cheese. 
         The sauce clings to each strand of pasta, creating a comforting and indulgent flavor in every bite.
    </p>
    <p>The dish is often finished with a sprinkle of freshly grated Parmesan and chopped parsley for added flavor and color.
         Its combination of savory chicken, creamy sauce, and perfectly cooked pasta makes Chicken Alfredo a popular choice for both casual dinners and special occasions.
