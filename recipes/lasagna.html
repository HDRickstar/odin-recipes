    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a rich, layered pasta dish that brings together tender sheets of noodles, savory meat sauce, creamy cheese, and aromatic herbs into one comforting bake. 
        Traditionally made with wide, flat pasta layered between a hearty tomato sauce—often simmered with ground beef or sausage—lasagna is known for its depth of flavor. 
        The sauce is typically seasoned with garlic, onions, basil, and oregano, creating a warm, fragrant base. 
        Between the layers, a mixture of ricotta cheese, mozzarella, and sometimes Parmesan adds a smooth, creamy contrast to the robust sauce.
    </p>
    <p>When baked, the top layer of cheese melts into a golden, bubbling crust while the inside remains soft and flavorful. 
        Each slice reveals distinct, colorful layers that hold together yet remain tender. 
        The combination of tangy tomato sauce, rich cheese, and perfectly cooked pasta creates a balanced bite that is both hearty and satisfying. 
        Often served hot and fresh from the oven, lasagna is a classic comfort food that brings a sense of warmth and tradition to the table.
