    <p>A hamburger is a classic sandwich built around a juicy ground beef patty, typically seasoned with salt and pepper and cooked on a grill or stovetop.
         The patty is placed inside a soft, lightly toasted bun and often topped with melted cheese, crisp lettuce, ripe tomato slices, onions, and pickles. 
         Condiments like ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise add extra flavor and moisture, creating a balanced combination of savory, tangy, and fresh tastes.
    </p>
    <p>Simple yet satisfying, the hamburger is known for its versatility. 
        It can be customized with different cheeses, sauces, or toppings like bacon and sautéed mushrooms.
         Whether served at a backyard cookout or a restaurant, the hamburger remains a popular comfort food that is hearty, flavorful, and easy to enjoy.
